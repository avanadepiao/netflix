In this unit, we will cover reinforcement learning. Here, we will venture into new 
territory, taking away the supervision we used in the supervised section. Instead of 
receiving feedback for every action taken, the agent will receive feedback only at the 
very end.

One of the most exciting examples of reinforcement learning is the recent success of 
machine playing AlphaGo. In this case, the machine does not receive a reward for every 
action; instead, the outcome of the entire game determines success.

We will begin by approaching reinforcement learning through a simplified scenario called 
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In MDPs, the machine identifies the best action plan 
when it knows all possible rewards and transitions between states.

Next, we will relax some of these assumptions and explore full reinforcement learning. 
In this case, the agent must interact with the world, collect rewards, and experience 
different transitions without prior knowledge of this informationâ€”similar to real-life 
scenarios.

By the end of this unit, you will have the opportunity to apply these concepts in a 
reinforcement learning project, where you will implement an agent capable of playing 
text-based games.
